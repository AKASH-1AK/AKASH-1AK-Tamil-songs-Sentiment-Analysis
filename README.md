# Tamil Songs Sentiment Analysis

## Project Description

This project implements sentiment analysis on Tamil songs lyrics to classify the emotions conveyed in the songs. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify the sentiment of the lyrics and categorizes them into various classes such as **positive**, **negative**, and **neutral**. This analysis aims to provide an emotional understanding of Tamil songs, helping users choose songs based on their mood.

### Key Features:
- Sentiment classification of Tamil songs' lyrics.
- The ability to handle song lyrics in Tamil, leveraging language-specific NLP techniques.
- The system uses machine learning models to predict the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of the lyrics.
- Visualizes the sentiment distribution for the analyzed songs.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AKASH-1AK/AKASH-1AK-Tamil-songs-Sentiment-Analysis.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd AKASH-1AK-Tamil-songs-Sentiment-Analysis
    ```

3. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On MacOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your dataset**: The dataset should consist of Tamil song lyrics with their corresponding sentiment labels. If you are using your own dataset, ensure it is in CSV format with columns such as `lyrics` and `sentiment`.

2. **Train the Model**: 
    You can train the model using the provided script `train_model.py`. This script trains the sentiment analysis model on the dataset you provide.
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

3. **Predict Sentiment**:
    After training, you can predict the sentiment of a new songâ€™s lyrics using the `predict.py` script:
    ```bash
    python predict.py "Enter the Tamil song lyrics here"
    ```

    The output will be the predicted sentiment: **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

4. **Visualize Results**: To visualize the distribution of sentiment across your dataset, use the `visualize.py` script:
    ```bash
    python visualize.py
    ```

## Data

- **Dataset Format**: The dataset should be in CSV format, containing columns like `lyrics` (the text of the song) and `sentiment` (the emotion label: `positive`, `negative`, `neutral`).
- **Source**: You can use publicly available datasets or create your own by scraping song lyrics from websites and labeling them manually.
