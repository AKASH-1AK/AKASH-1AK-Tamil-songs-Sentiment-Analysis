# Tamil Songs Sentiment Analysis

## Project Description

This project implements sentiment analysis on Tamil songs lyrics to classify the emotions conveyed in the songs. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify the sentiment of the lyrics and categorizes them into various classes such as **positive**, **negative**, and **neutral**. This analysis aims to provide an emotional understanding of Tamil songs, helping users choose songs based on their mood.

### Key Features:
- Sentiment classification of Tamil songs' lyrics.
- The ability to handle song lyrics in Tamil, leveraging language-specific NLP techniques.
- The system uses machine learning models to predict the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of the lyrics.
- Visualizes the sentiment distribution for the analyzed songs.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AKASH-1AK/AKASH-1AK-Tamil-songs-Sentiment-Analysis.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd AKASH-1AK-Tamil-songs-Sentiment-Analysis
    ```

3. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On MacOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your dataset**: The dataset should consist of Tamil song lyrics with their corresponding sentiment labels. If you are using your own dataset, ensure it is in CSV format with columns such as `lyrics` and `sentiment`.

2. **Train the Model**: 
    You can train the model using the provided script `train_model.py`. This script trains the sentiment analysis model on the dataset you provide.
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

3. **Predict Sentiment**:
    After training, you can predict the sentiment of a new songâ€™s lyrics using the `predict.py` script:
    ```bash
    python predict.py "Enter the Tamil song lyrics here"
    ```

    The output will be the predicted sentiment: **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

4. **Visualize Results**: To visualize the distribution of sentiment across your dataset, use the `visualize.py` script:
    ```bash
    python visualize.py
    ```

## Data

- **Dataset Format**: The dataset should be in CSV format, containing columns like `lyrics` (the text of the song) and `sentiment` (the emotion label: `positive`, `negative`, `neutral`).
- **Source**: You can use publicly available datasets or create your own by scraping song lyrics from websites and labeling them manually.

## Dependencies

The following Python packages are required to run the project:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `sklearn`: For machine learning models.
- `matplotlib`: For visualizing sentiment distribution.
- `nltk`: For natural language processing tasks.
- `tensorflow` or `keras`: For deep learning models (if applicable).
- `beautifulsoup4`: For scraping data (optional, if scraping is involved).

You can install the dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## How It Works
## Data Preprocessing:

The Tamil song lyrics are preprocessed to remove noise, such as punctuation, stop words, and irrelevant characters.
The text is tokenized, and important words are extracted. A method like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is used to convert the text into numerical vectors, enabling the model to understand the structure of the song's sentiment.
Text Vectorization:

Word Embeddings (like Word2Vec, GloVe) can be used to convert individual words into vector representations, allowing the model to capture the semantic meaning of words in the lyrics.
The vectorized text data is then prepared for training.
Model Building:

Several machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Naive Bayes are used to build a model for sentiment analysis.
If you are using a deep learning approach, models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) can be used for better context understanding in the text.
Model Training:

The sentiment analysis model is trained on the preprocessed and vectorized dataset. The model is evaluated on a validation set, and hyperparameters are tuned for better accuracy.
The training process ensures that the model can predict the sentiment of unseen song lyrics.
Prediction:

Once the model is trained, it is used to predict the sentiment of new song lyrics. The predicted output will be one of three sentiments: positive, negative, or neutral.
Visualization:

After predictions are made, the sentiment distribution (i.e., how many songs fall into each sentiment category) is visualized using tools like matplotlib to give an overview of the emotional tone of the analyzed Tamil songs.
